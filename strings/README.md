# Instructions

Each assignment has an existing number of unit tests. Some are passing and other are disabled.
Your task is to implement the functionality using the test harness as a guide. Enable each
the tests one by to implement the functionality.

# Homework

## Is Unique

Given a string, implement a method that determines if it contains unique characters. This method
will be case sensitive. For example, "Aa" is unique but "AA" is not unique. 

**Extra Credit:**
* Create a second method that ignores character case and spaces.
* Implement the algorithm without the help of String utility classes.
* Implement without using other second data structures. 

## Check Permutation

Given two strings, write a method that checks if one is a permutation of another.

**Extra Credit:**
* Create two different algorithms checking for permutations.
* Create a second check permutation method that ignores case. ***Do not*** use a 
***flag*** parameter to change the behavior of the existing method.
